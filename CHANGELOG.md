  Thanks [Manuel](https://github.com/filiph/linkcheck/pull/82)!

  [Guillaume](https://github.com/filiph/linkcheck/commits?author=Mogztter)!

## 2.0.18

- Allow the latest `pkg:args`

## 2.0.17

- Update to latest dependencies.
- Require Dart 2.12.

## 2.0.16

- Add a summary of the most broken links (as opposed to just warnings) 
  at the end of the listing. This only happens when most of the normal listing
  above is mostly (50%+) warnings. This should help when a big site has
  thousands of small warnings because of, say, missing anchors, but the author
  is currently trying to catch the failing errors.
- Fix `--show-redirects` functionality.
  [Thanks @nfagerlund!](https://github.com/filiph/linkcheck/pull/64)!

## 2.0.15

- Improve stability by handling several failures more gracefully
  ([#57](https://github.com/filiph/linkcheck/issues/57),
  [#63](https://github.com/filiph/linkcheck/issues/63),
  [#51](https://github.com/filiph/linkcheck/issues/51),
  [#40](https://github.com/filiph/linkcheck/issues/40))

## 2.0.14

- Add the `--no-check-anchors` flag, which prevents reporting missing anchors
  as problems. This is useful when the link-checked website uses anchors 
  (like `#play` or `#user=bob`) for dynamic content (i.e. they are handled
  by JavaScript and don't exist in the static HTML).
  [Thanks @emielbeinema](https://github.com/filiph/linkcheck/pull/56)
  for this contribution!

## 2.0.13

- Add the `--show-redirects` flag, which reports redirected links.
  This is handy if you want to minimize the number of hoops the browser needs
  to jump through to get to linked pages. Ideally, all your site's links
  are direct, with zero redirects.
  [Thanks @emielbeinema](https://github.com/filiph/linkcheck/pull/54)
  for this contribution!
- Make everything more type-safe by disallowing Dart features "implicit-casts"
  and "implicit-dynamic".
- Turn on `pedantic` linter.
